<h2 class = "About"> About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hello I am Chasyn Pollard, I am currently a Junior in GCMS High School who is wanting to pursue a career, and a higher education in the computer science/programming field. I love programming and the problem solving that goes hand in hand with it. I am currently enrolled at GCMS High School and I participate in a program called ECCA at parkland college where I spend the first 3 hours of my day taking programming college courses. I have lettered in both track and soccer, and I can play the saxophone. I work at a local restaurant called "The Horch Radish '' where I wash dishes and occasionally help in the Kitchen. My favorite game is "Portal 2", and my go to games to play with friends are "Jack-Box" and "Dead by Daylight". I plan to attend college after high school and major in Computer Science.

  I have taken multiple computer science courses through Parkland College including : CIS 122; introduction to computer programming (python), CIS 152; Web Design 1 (html, CSS), CSC 155; Systems Development, CSC 140; Computer Science 1 (Java). I am proficient in Python, HTML, and CSS, I am also experienced in Java, PHP, and C#. I learned Python, HTML, CSS, JAVA, and PHP in my college classes, and I learned C# through following a guide on how to make a video game, in which I made a video game then ripped it apart leaving nothing but the bare bones and with the knowledge i gained from making it I made it into a completely different video game and learned more as I Built it up (See: <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>). I can learn many things using this and different other approaches. I wish there was more time in a day so I could do and learn more.  
<br>I have had a whole semester class on databases and have run code through databases and made interactive websites using those databases. I have also worked on and completed a video game called "Word Runner". Not to mention I can also create websites from scratch like this website you are on right now. I can play the saxophone and I am provient in the most random useless information known to mankind.

 I take College level computer science classes, as a high school junior and I am currently passing all of them. I got first in FBLA's (Future Business Leaders of America) Illiois central area conference computer Computer Simulation and video game design with my game "Word Runner" (See: <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>), which I plan to take to the FBLA state conference later this spring. I have been the secretary for my local 4H group for __ years. I also currently have a 3.79 unweighted gpa.
