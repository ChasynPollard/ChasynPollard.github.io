<p>
  Hello I am Chasyn Pollard, I am currently a Jounor in GCMS High School who is wanting to proceed a carreer, and a higher educaltion in the computer science/programing field. I love programming and the problum solving that goes hand in hand with it. I am curretly enrolled at GCMS High School and I pertispate in a program called ECCA at parkland collage where I spend the first 3 hours of my day taking programmng collage coruses. I have lettered in both track and soccer, and I can play the saxiphone. I work at a local restrant called "The Horch Radish" where I wash dishes and occinally help in the Kitchen. My favirte game is "Portal 2", and my go to game to play with freinds is "Jack-Box" and "Dead by Daylight". I plan to attend collage after high school and major in Computer Science.

  I have taken mulitable computer scinece courses through Parkland Collage including : CIS 122; introduction to computer programming (python), CIS 152; Web Design 1 (html, CSS), CSC 155; Systems Devoplment, CSC 140; Computer Scince 1 (Java). I am provient in Python, HTML, and CSS, I am also expernced in Java, PHP, and C#. I learned Python, HTML, CSS, JAVA, and PHP in my collage classes, and I learned C# through following a guilde on how to make a video game, in which I made a video game then ripped it apart leaving nothing but the bare bones and with the knowalge i gained from making it I made it into a completely diffrent video game and learned more as I Built it up (See: <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>). I can learn many things using this and diffrent other aproches. I wish there was more time in a day so I could do and learn more. 
<br>I have had a whole semester class on databases and have ran code through databases and made interactive websites useing those databases. I have also worked on and completed a video game called "Word Runner". Not to mention I can also create websites from scratch like this wesite you are on right now. I can play the saxaphone and I am provient in the most random useless infermation known to mankind.
